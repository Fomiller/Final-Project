Final Project Market Research

We chose to create a chat application for out final project because now more then ever we need to be able to stay connected with those around us. Social distancing has become more prominent then ever before in the last few months due to the covid-19 outbreak. Tools such as Slack, Discord, Zoom, and Google Hangouts are great working examples of real world applications that are seeing a massive influx in users. 

Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield outlined his week during the initial stages of the outbreak in a Twitter thread. In on tuesday of the week of March 9th-13th Stewart Made note that Slack passed over 10 million simultaneously connected users. This occurred 1,597 days (Oct. ‘15) after the Slack team recorded their first 1 million simultaneously connected users. 6 days after the 10 million user milestone Slack reached, “ten million. 6 days later: 10.5M, then 11.0M. Next day, 11.5M. This Monday, 12M. Today 12.5M.” according to Stewarts Tweet. This Rapid increase in numbers shows why the communication sector  has room to grow more now then ever.

Other popular apps have also shown a dramatic increase in usage in the recent weeks. Facebook owned “WhatsApp has seen a 40% increase in usage that grew from an initial 27% bump in the earlier days of the pandemic to 41% in the mid phase.”, according to TechCrunch.com.  WhatsApp usage in Spain where the country has been under total lockdown is up 76%.

In a market that is often described as over saturated, our team saw an opportunity. 
With the market primed for a new competitor our team set out to create a new communication based application to connect everyone to those around them with what we find to be the best features of its competitors. 

Features that our team deemed to be necessary to be a successful application are as follows.
Most notably from Discord, a popular messaging application used in the gaming community that allows for text, VOIP, and Video calls, is the native dark mode theme throughout the entire application. More and more people are demanding ‘dark modes’ for popular applications that are used for prolonged periods of time to ease the strain on the users eyes. 

Slack the number one download in team communication apps on the apple app store and the google play store, is quickly replacing email in the modern age of communication. This is due to the ability to create group messages for smaller groups of individuals, Channels for general messaging across specific teams, and direct messages for when you need to have a one on one conversation with another person. Slack makes communication between a group of people or a single user equally as easy and it is a notable feature that our team is structuring our application around. 

The number one reoccuring feature that stood out when doing research for our communication app was. Ease of use. This will be the number one feature and goal that our team reach for. We are currently in a situation where we do not need communication to be harder. We need it to be easier.
